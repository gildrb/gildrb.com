 *   and the index turns to noise. 300ms was tried; 200ms is the owner's pick.

 *   state inherits the color (`color: inherit`) rather than setting its own, or it switches at
 *   once while its row fades. Elements that set their own state color carry `ui.respond`.
 * Nothing travels toward the pointer and no marker follows the reader: state is color. The only

/**
 * The type scale: three sizes, two weights, and tracking that follows the size.
 *
 * Why three sizes and two weights, not one of each: one size at one weight leaves color as the
 * only way to rank text, and a page ranked by gray alone reads as a data listing. The scale adds
 * two more axes: size tells a label from a line of text from the name, and weight tells the
 * thing (a project's name, a page's heading) from what is said about it.
 *
 * Every size sits on the 24px line (three units), so nothing moves between pages: the name is
 * the same size in the same place on the homepage and on every page under it, where the page's
 * title takes the line below it as its child. The heading size, 22px, is the size whose cap
 * height (Inter's is 0.727em) is 16px: two units on a three-unit line. The label's line is 20px
 * in the same 24px box. Phones use the same pixels; from tablets up text scales with `rem`.
 *
 * Tracking is Inter's own dynamic metrics (rsms.me/inter/dynmetrics): `a + b * e^(c * size)`
 * with a = -0.0223, b = 0.185, c = -0.1745, size in px. It tightens as type grows, which is why
 * 14px gets -0.006em, 16px -0.011em and 22px -0.018em. The date figures are calibrated against
 * letters tracked this way (`ui.figures` adds `textTracking`).
 *
 * Weights: 400 is text; 500 is emphasis, the step Inter's optical size keeps clearly apart from
 * 400 at every size here (the font file carries 380 to 600, see `scripts/inter.py`). Nothing is
 * bolder: on a dark page 600 blooms. The share image (`og.tsx`) draws from a 400-only instance.

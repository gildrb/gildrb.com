Names forgive typos.\nFrom a terminal, `heph notes` opens the armory called notes, and `heph` inside an armory\nfolder opens that folder. Outside any armory, `heph` opens this guide.\n\n## Which files can Heph read?',

    text: '# Start here\n\n## What is Heph?\n\nHeph answers questions from your own files and shows where each answer came from.\nYou ask in plain words. Heph finds the passages that match, sends them to your model,\nand prints the answer with citations such as [E1] that point back to the file and page.\n\nThis armory is the Heph guide. It holds these pages about Heph itself, so you can learn\nHeph by asking Heph. Try: "how do I add my own files?" or "which models can I use?"\n\n## What is an armory?\n\nAn armory is a folder of files that Heph answers from. Every file in the folder is\nmaterial: notes, PDFs, Word documents, slides, spreadsheets, code. Heph never changes\nyour files. It keeps its index and chats in a hidden `.harness` folder inside the armory.\n\nYou are in one armory at a time. Its name is shown under the prompt, next to the model.\n\n## The first three things to do\n\n1. Ask a question here, to see how answers and citations look.\n2. Make your own armory: run `heph init` in a folder of your files, or type `/armory`.\n3. Pick your model with `/model` if the default local server is not the one you use.',

You can also type `/model http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`.\nIf the server wants an API key, Heph asks for it once and saves it.\n\n## How do I log in to OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek or Z.AI?\n\nType `/login` and pick the provider, then paste your API key. Press Enter without a key\nto use the key in the provider\'s environment variable instead, like OPENAI_API_KEY.\nThen pick a model with `/model`. `/logout` removes a login and its saved key.\n\n## How do I use my ChatGPT subscription?\n\nType `/login` and pick "ChatGPT subscription (Codex)".
